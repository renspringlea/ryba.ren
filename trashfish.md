> In this poignant collection, Dr Ren Ryba—a transgender woman and social justice advocate—grapples with the complexities of identity, fear, and hope in a world often hostile to those who are different.  
>  
> With a melancholic yet constructive voice, these essays explore the complexities of discrimination against trans people, sexuality and neurodivergence, and the paradoxes of spirituality and faith for queer individuals. Woven throughout are moving reflections on Ryba's professional work in animal advocacy and intimate portraits of caring for special-needs animals, which offer insight into how glimmers of hope can be found.  
>  
> This collection is a powerful testament to our capacity to challenge oppression and a call to action for a more just and compassionate world.

Notes:
- I am choosing not to charge for this book, as I have the privilege of full-time work that pays a living wage and see no need to acquire any money beyond that. Any incidental money that comes my way from this book is donated to top charities via [Givewell](https://www.givewell.org/).
- My book is not available on Kindle, as [Amazon are baddies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Amazon).
- The MP3 audiobook file is produced using automated text-to-speech software ([Piper](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper?tab=readme-ov-file), with the voice Hfc Medium Female). I am providing the file here purely for accessibility, as not everybody can read text on a screen. I support paying professional narrators for audiobooks that are intended to be sold commercially.
