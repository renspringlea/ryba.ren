Notes:
- I am choosing not to charge for this book, as I have the privilege of a full-time job that pays a living wage and see no need to acquire any money beyond that. Any incidental money that comes my way from this book is donated to top charities via [Givewell](https://www.givewell.org/).
- My book is not available on Kindle, as [Amazon are baddies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Amazon).
- The MP3 audiobook file is produced using automated text-to-speech software ([Piper](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper?tab=readme-ov-file), with the voice Hfc Medium Female). I am providing the file here purely for accessibility, as not everybody can read text on a screen. I support paying professional narrators for audiobooks that are intended to be sold commercially.
