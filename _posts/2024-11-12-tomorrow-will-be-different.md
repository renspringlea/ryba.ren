In the recent US election, the US Congress got its first openly transgender repâ€”Sarah McBride, a Democrat from Delaware.

Sarah McBride's [merch store](https://store.sarahmcbride.com/) has some really cool stuff, but sadly the store only ships to the US.

Instead, I used the cute "Tomorrow Will Be Different" sticker to make a computer wallpaper!
