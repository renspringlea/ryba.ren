1. Picture a paramedic on call. When there is an emergency, their attention *must* be diverted to that emergency. If the paramedic fails to be contacted, there will be unnecessary suffering.  
2. Picture a knowledge worker focusing on some long-term goal (e.g. reducing poverty or advocating for human rights or whatever). Their attention *must not* be diverted *away* from that goal. If the knowledge worker becomes distracted, there will be unnecessary suffering.  
3. Point #2 is not literal; human minds work the way that human minds work, not the way that computer programs work. There is a positive level of distraction that needs to be built into a worthy and constructive existence (it's called "everyday life").  
4. But if you fall into the description in point #2 rather than the description in point #1, then it really is okay—indeed, it is *best*—to tune out as much as you can other than your most essential projects (interpreted broadly to include your high-impact work and also things that are essential for your human existence, like family and exercise and hobbies).  
5. If you are serving a community (e.g. people living in poverty; farmed animals), then tuning out external information to a degree that might seem excessive to the average person is really just giving the community that you are serving what they deserve: your sole focus.  
6. (The exception, of course, is when somebody is trying to communicate genuinely essential information to you. I think that people systematically overestimate how frequently this happens, and this is the role of well-designed email filters and the like.)  
7. Thus, every bounced text message/phone call/email is evidence that you are prioritising correctly.  
  
You can tell I'm a riot at parties.
