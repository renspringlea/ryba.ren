Motivating philosophies, in order of importance:
- Theory of change (reducing suffering is my primary responsibility)
- Mental health (don't die)
- Focus (it's easier to do those first two items if I'm not distracted)
- Simplicity (to support focus)
- Privacy (because the internet is scary)

Documents are all Markdown, which looks nice but is stored as plain text and therefore easy to sync, read, etc. The two key documents are:
- Focus (the central document, see below)
- Review (for your weekly, monthly, and annual reviews and containing your overarching goals and lists of projects)
- And then separate notes in a separate folder (for notes you do want to keep)

The Focus page is the document that I have open on my computer all the time. The idea is to have a way to structure my work, while only seeing the things I need to be able to see while work. The Page contains:
- The Task (the single thing I am working on at the moment - one item only)
- Chunk Tasks (other tasks to be completed as a batch at the end of the day - and in fact, these go to "Review" where possible to batch them to the end of the week)

Computer software:
- Linux (because Windows is so bloated with useless features and notifications that it makes my blood pressure rise whenever I have to use it)
- Chromium (with uBlock Origin and Bitwarden) for actually performing work
- Linux's built-in Calendar (which can sync with Google Calendar and TeamApp calendars)
- A radio app tuned to SomaFM (free, 24/7, ad-free ambient music)
- A pomodoro timer
- Pulsar (for the key text files)
- NextCloud (for syncing local files)

Phone apps:
- Minimalist Phone (turns my phone screen into a list of apps)
- Nextcloud Notes (for viewing and editing the five key text files from my phone)
- Plum Village (for meditation)
- Libby (free audiobooks from my local library!)
- Firefox Focus
