*Content warning: eating disorders, suicidal ideation*

I frequently encounter both disordered eating and suicidal ideation (both of which I have written about in detail in my [book]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link trashfish.md %}) and in other blog posts({% post_url 2025-01-13-soccer-body %})). My brain tries to tell me "If you feel like you're fat, you're clearly fat" or "If you feel like you're worthless, you're clearly worthless". I find it useful to see examples of people who are clearly highly skilled and accomplished athletes who also suffer from these challenges. These provide rock-solid counterexamples to those beliefs held by my brain. Equipped with these examples, it is easy to see that the fact that you think you are fat does not carry any information about your body. Likewise, the fact that you think you are worthless does not carry any information about your value.

Here are three examples.

Clare Shine has 7 caps with the Republic of Ireland national soccer team. Despite clearly being a world-class soccer player, she suffered from serious emotional challenges, due to which she turned to alcoholism. She also suffered from eating disorders, especially alongside her need to take antidepressant medication.

Briana Scurry was born into immensely disadvantaged conditions and became the starting goalkeeper in the famous "99'ers" US soccer team. She helped her team win gold in two Summer Olympics and the famous 1999 World Cup. After gaining some weight, she felt that she had "dishonored the U.S. Soccer crest". After her career was ended due to a traumatic brain injury (and she was royally screwed by insurance companies), she "came close a few times" to jumping off of a bridge into a waterfall.

Alex Scott was a part of the Arsenal team that won a quadruple, including winning the Champions League, and she retired with 145 caps for the England and Great Britain national teams. Despite this, she acknowledges having body image issues. She is insecure about her butt and quad muscles, especially in her post-soccer media career where she frequently encounters professional models.
