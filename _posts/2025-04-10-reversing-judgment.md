Like most people born into the species *Homo sapiens*, I am frequently quick to judge. I find it quite funny; I am quick to judge others in situations where I would not judge myself, but I am also quick to judge myself in situations where I would not judge others.

This is the practice that I like to adopt.

Rather than judging others, I imagine how much grace I would show myself in their situation. We frequently give ourselves grace, offer ourselves the benefit of the doubt, and make reference to extenuating circumstances, and we can do the same for others.

Rather than judging myself, I imagine how much grace I would show somebody else in my situation. I am my own worst enemy, and I often belittle myself for not being like others. But if I met myself, I'd probably feel envious about all the good things going on in my life!

Brains are truly ridiculous.
