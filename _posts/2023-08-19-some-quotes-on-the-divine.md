1. “God is not somewhere else, but right here, all around us, the encompassing Spirit in whom everything that is, is.” - Borg, Marcus J 2011, *Jesus: Uncovering the life, teachings and relevance of a religious revolutionary*, ch5.
2. “Julian [of Norwich]’s understanding of love is not that it moves in one direction but is reciprocal.” - Ramirez, Janina 2016, *Julian of Norwich: A Very Brief History*.
3. The Buddha teaches us that self and other, mind and form, are not separate. Bodhidharma teaches us that mind is enlightenment. Dogen teaches us that sitting in meditation is waking up to enlightenment, which is always present.
4. Abraham Maslow teaches us that self-actualisation is a process, something you *do*, not a permanent state of being.
5. Thus, waking up to enlightenment, becoming aware of the ever-present Divine, is something you can do rather than something you achieve. To practice, to love, to sit and awaken to the illusion of separation - this is the doing that constitutes enlightenment itself. Interbeing, unconditional love, infinite peace and freedom.
