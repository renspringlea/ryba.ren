title: "The four layers of reality"
tags: microblog philosophy self-improvement

1. Concrete objects. Book, tree, human.
2. The characteristics of objects. Educational, green, intelligent.
3. Our judgements about those characteristics. Profound, calming, valuable.
4. Our judgements about those judgements. More/less successful, more/less desirable, more/less wealthy.
5. The latter two layers (judgements and judgements-about-judgements) donâ€™t have any basis beyond our minds, and seem like their entire purpose is to help us drive ourselves nuts chasing after things. The first layer (objects), and to a lesser degree the second layer (characteristics), do seem to exist as features of reality, though even these layers still require a particular level of discrimination and judgement on the part of the observer. What's underneath the first layer?
