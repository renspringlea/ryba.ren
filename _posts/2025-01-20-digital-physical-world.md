Or, in defence of Digimon! :P

I've noticed that avoiding the need to create or engage with physical objects means that you can increase the speed of your feedback loops and get things done faster.

Examples:

- Diary/productivity system. I love the vibes of a physical diary. But having a diary or productivity system that is purely digital (on my phone and my computer) means that it's much more flexible. Making changes takes just a few seconds, not the minutes it would take to modify a physical diary or the days/weeks it would take to acquire new physical components of a diary.
- Reading and writing ebooks rather than physical books. Reading a physical book means that you have to either buy it from a book shop, order it from the internet, or get it from the library. This takes time! An ebook (or audiobook) in contrast you can acquire immediately. This reduces the time between wanting to read a book and reading it. It also means you can give up on books faster if you decide that the book sucks (which I do often!). Similar considerations apply to writing; writing and publishing an ebook, as I've recently learned, is very fast, but publishing a physical book is a fairly slow process.
- Church shopping. Many churches etc stream their services online; when I'm looking for a new church that I vibe with, just looking at the online streams means I can easily get a good feel for ~3-5 on a single Sunday, rather than having to drive around.
