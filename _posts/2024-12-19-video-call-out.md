title: "If you invite somebody to a video call, give them an out"
---

In EA circles, since we mostly work remotely, there's a culture of asking a colleague to "hop on a video call" to sort out a particular question or problem.

I think this is great and speaks to a scrappy problem-solving attitude. I like that we have this mindset.

However, video calls don't work for everyone. I find them disproportionately taxing mentally and physically. I'd estimate that a 30-minute phone call reduces my day's effective working time by ~90-120 minutes.

There is already some understanding of this in the community, which is good progress, though it's mostly in the form of "Zoom fatigue".

So I think it's good, when offering to hop on a video call with somebody, to say something like "If you don't have the capacity for a video call, I'm sure we can figure it out via written communication."
