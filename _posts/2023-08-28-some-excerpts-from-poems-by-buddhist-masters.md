1.\
I'll let it all go and head home to the West,\
And the bright moon will blanket the earth just as before.\
-- Wuwei, Early and Mid-Ming Dynasty (1368-1600), tr. Grant, Beata 2012, *Daughters of Emptiness: Poems of Chinese Buddhist Nuns*

2.\
The lone reed at the river's mouth is about to be snapped in two,\
When you set off to the West, we'll go there hand in hand.\
-- Zaisheng, Late Ming and Early Qing Dynasty (1600-1750), tr. Grant

3.\
What happened three thousand *li* away was enough to break one's heart,\
What happened twelve years ago has made my tears flow dark and red.\
-- Daoyuan, Late Ming and Early Qing Dynasty (1600-1750), tr. Grant

4.\
Someone says that God has consented for mankind to step up and help Him.\
We have walked hand in hand since time immemorial.\
-- Thich Nhat Hanh, *Butterflies Over the Golden Mustard Fields*, in Sister Chan Khong, *Learning True Love* ch5

5.\
It seems like only yesterday that you told me,\
"If one day, you find everything destroyed,\
then look for me in the depths of your heart."\
-- Thich Nhat Hanh, *Butterflies Over the Golden Mustard Fields*, in Sister Chan Khong, *Learning True Love* ch5 (but also see the journal entry of 20 August 1962 in *Fragrant Palm Leaves: Journals 1962-1996*, tr. Warren, Mobi)
