1. Write and publish academic papers in plain text using markdown, Pandoc and Citeproc - [Scott Selisker](https://u.arizona.edu/~selisker/post/workflow/)
2. Read RSS feeds and newsletters in plain text using [newsboat](https://newsboat.org/index.html)
3. To-do lists and task management using the [todo.txt format](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt) or the [today.txt format](https://github.com/jukil/plain-text-life/blob/master/today.txt) (though both have got too many moving parts for me! I use a similar but simpler method)
4. Calendar using the Calendar.txt format - [Tero Karvinen](https://terokarvinen.com/2021/calendar-txt/)
5. Journal in plain text - [George Coghill](https://georgecoghill.wordpress.com/plain-text/)
6. Budgeting and keeping track of your money - there are some sophisticated plain text accounting tools like ledger, but for my purposes and after extensive research, I've landed on the very simple system of just keeping a plain text list of accounts and then manually updating the list of accounts each week
7. Write websites using [Jeykll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) with [Github Pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/)
8. Do statistical programming in R (and why would you want to use another statistical programming language anyway? historically I've wanted to use other packages for spatial data analysis and non-linear optimisation, but terra and TMB are so good that I don't even feel that need anymore)
9. Sync your text files across your devices using [syncthing](https://syncthing.net/)
10. Using [Pulsar text editor](https://pulsar-edit.dev/) and its packages, you can do more than you'd think possible (e.g. script-runner to run bash scripts from inside the text editor, such as when you want to update your website) - Pulsar is like R for plain text
