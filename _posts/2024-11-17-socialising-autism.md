title: "You can socialise without having to socialise"
---

Most people have the human need to socialise at some level. In the book *Loneliness: Human Nature and the Need for Social Connection* (John T. Cacioppo and William Patrick), the authors draw a comparison with food/hunger: under this conceptualisation, loneliness is nothing more complicated than your body telling you that you need to get more of this particular resource (social connection).

But social connection doesn't need to be social.

In the field of autism and neurodivergent studies, there's this idea that neurodivergent people often get deep enjoyment from connecting with things that aren't necessarily other people. Therefore, for these people (which includes me, though obviously autism is no monolith), "loneliness" can be a sign that you need to connect with *whatever is deeply meaningful for you*. You can get the deep satisfaction of connection without having to actually spend time with another person.

(I'm not sure where this idea originates from specificallyâ€”my therapist has promised to tell me if they remember!)

Examples that seem to do it for me:

1. Cuddling my dogs
2. Watching videos about old houses
3. Baking fresh bread
4. Contemplating spiritual/religious stuff
5. Working on a stimulating programming project

Of course, I do enjoy spending time with people I like! But this isn't *necessary* for exploring these deep connections, which gives me many more options and immense freedom in when and how I choose to use these options.
