title: "Notes on tattoos and melanoma"  
---  
[Kluger and Thomas 2008, The Dragon With Atypical Mole Syndrome](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/419808)  
- "(1) avoid getting the tattoo at too young an age when all the nevi have not appeared yet; (2) choose a small design; (3) choose an area devoid of nevi, if possible; and (4) choose light colors rather than dark ones"  

[Monfrecola et al 2023, Could wide tattoo delay the early diagnosis of cutaneous melanoma?](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jdv.19037)  
- "Tattoo extension, especially in the back, leads to an increasing risk for diagnosis delay, as reported by our patient: this remarks the difficulty to detect growing lesions due to the size of tattoo as well as the colour."  
- "Lesions identification could be hampered by the presence of tattoo, which makes more difficult the detection and the surveillance of pigmented lesions."  

[Kluger 2023, Tattoos, tattooists, moles and melanomas](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jdv.19170)  
- "only 20% of the cutaneous melanoma on tattoos develop on a preexisting naevus"  
- "there is no ground to suggest that any given tattooed individual undergoes 'tightened' surveillance if he is not at higher risk of melanoma or if the tattoo is not covering numerous moles [...] Education of the general population, more practical advice regarding self-inspection, can be efficacious for early detection and has been the main goal of the yearly Euromelanoma campaigns."  
- "Regarding tattooists, they are usually aware that they should not tattoo over a mole as a rule, even though there are always mistakes."  
- "most of the professional tattooists are inspecting the skin of their customers before tattooing. Half of them have already spotted what they considered as a 'suspicious' lesion on one of their customers last year. Almost 70% of them recommended seeking advice from their healthcare provider."  

It's interesting to me that there are reasons why tattoos might make it harder to spot melanomas (design interfering with skin checks) but also easier (closer inspection of skin by self or artist).  

A rough calculation, even playing devil's advocate and ignoring that positive effect:  
- For the average adult human, the skin has a surface area of 1.5–2.0 square metres ([Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skin)).  
- That makes 17,500 square centimetres.  
- Consider a typical tattoo, let's say it's 5 cm x 5 cm. That makes it 25 square centimetres.  
- This would cover 0.14% of the body.  
- Assume that the tattoo is placed on a portion of the skin with an exactly average probability of getting melanoma. (This is obviously wrong—e.g. I'd guess tattoos are more likely to be on visible areas of the skin, which are also areas exposed to the sun and thus more likely to get melanoma. Bear with me!)  
- A random Australian website tells me that 1 in 22 Australian women are diagnosed with melanoma before age 85. That makes it 4.5%.  
- So, for each of our theoretical tattoos, there would be a 0.14 % * 4.5 % = < 0.01% chance of having a melanoma *on the area of the tattoo*.  
- So even if a tattoo makes it more difficult to spot a melanoma by some percentage, the actual lifetime risk of facing the situation "has melanoma on tattoo and failed to detect it because of the tattoo" would also be < 0.01%.  

Regarding the suggestion of Kluger and Thomas (2008) to wait to get tattoos until all the nevi have appeared:  
- Nevi numbers peak at age 30 and then gradually decrease, in a study of "Caucasian female subjects (2,786)" from the UK ([Bataille et al 2007](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6211218_Nevus_Size_and_Number_Are_Associated_with_Telomere_Length_and_Represent_Potential_Markers_of_a_Decreased_Senescence_In_vivo))  
- "Total nevus counts tend to increase until the 4th decade of life before decreasing in the elderly. The prevailing explanation for this age‐related effect has been that people develop new nevi in early life and lose nevi in later life. In fact, this nevus volatility has been observed in paediatric cohorts—over a follow‐up period of 3–7 years, up to 75% of patients had new nevi, and 28% had nevi that disappeared. In later life, there could be a shift, whereby disappearing nevi exceed new nevi. However, in adult cohorts, data on change in nevus counts with age has been inconclusive. An account for the conflicting data could be that the association between nevus counts and age is an artefact of cross‐sectional studies, and differences in ultraviolet radiation (UV) exposure across birth cohorts may explain the disparity in nevus counts by age." ([Reiter et al 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9804380/#jdv18470-sec-0006))  
- "In terms of nevus counts, our results suggest that patients continue to acquire new nevi and most patients experience an overall increase in nevus counts over time." (ibid) (and eyeballing their results, it seems like the new nevi stop appearing around age 30 or 40)  

And lastly, my paper award of the year goes to: [Rahmat et al 2023, Skin cancer incidence in transgender individuals receiving gender-affirming hormone treatment: a nationwide cohort study in the Netherlands](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ijd.16707)  
- "The cohort consisted of 2,436 trans women and 1,444 trans men. The median age at the start of GAHT was 31 years (IQR 24–42) in trans women and 24 years (IQR 20–32) in trans men. The median follow-up time for trans women was 8 years (IQR 3–18) with a total follow-up time of 29,152 years and 4 years (IQR 2–12) with a total follow-up time of 12,469 years for trans men."  
- "Eight trans women were diagnosed with melanoma (SIR 1.80 [95% CI 0.83–3.41] vs. all men; SIR 1.40 [0.65–2.65] vs. all women), and seven developed squamous cell carcinoma (SIR 0.78 [0.34–1.55] vs. all men; SIR 1.15 [0.50–2.27] vs. all women). Two trans men developed melanoma (SIR 1.05 [0.18–3.47] vs. all men; SIR 0.77 [0.14-2.70] vs. all women)."  
- "GAHT did not appear to affect skin cancer incidence in this large cohort of transgender individuals."  
- "Melanoma incidence among trans women has previously been assessed in a study from the United States on overall cancer incidence in 4,889 transgender individuals from the Kaiser Permanente database linked with the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database and was found not to be different compared with the cisgender population. However, information on hormone use was not provided in this study. More recently, Singer et al. examined the relation between gender identity and self-reported lifetime prevalence of skin cancer in a population, also in the United States, that included cisgender, transgender, and gender nonconforming individuals, also without taking GAHT into account. In accordance with our analysis, no significantly different odds ratios of skin cancer history among trans men or trans women, compared with cisgender men, were reported."
