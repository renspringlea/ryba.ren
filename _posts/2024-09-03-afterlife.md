Consider this passage, which comes from a systematic comparison of the images of afterlifes in world religions:  
> Heaven is described in very pastoral scenes, featuring images such as radiant sunlight, flowing streams, singing birds, and refreshing breezes. Sometimes paradise is described in terms of splendid jewels and radiant gems. Sensual pleasures, like food and sex, are indicated in several traditions [...] however, all of the faiths considered have urged that the truest pleasure in heaven is one of transcendence, leaving worldly desires behind. In some instances, namely in the Judeo-Christian-Islamic tradition, this transcendence comes in the form of a personal nearness to God. In the Eastern traditions, especially those of a more mystical bent, the transcendence is generally seen as an overcoming of personal relationships in acquiescence to the greater whole.

(Christopher M. Moreman, *Beyond the Threshold: Afterlife Beliefs and Experiences in World Religions*, ch12)  

I'm inclined to add (mentioned a couple of times in the book in other contexts, so less systematic, though it seems reasonable to me on the grounds that I'm a human on planet earth): being reunited with loved ones in some form and/or being assured of their wellbeing.  

So to paraphrase, we have basically all the big religions studied in the book saying that heaven—the best possible place to be—is basically a warm, sunny pastoral scene with simple pleasures and maybe loved ones and/or God.  
  
This is extremely interesting to me because these are all things that can be achieved on Earth—and (excepting the transcendence for the sake of argument) it's very easy to do!
