1. Supercomputer. The tasks for which you have been placed on planet Earth and that need to be done extremely well and effectively. Leverage powerful technology. (e.g. [systematic reviews on your area of expertise](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32004673/))
2. Set and forget. The more mundane tasks that need to be done but for which good enough is enough. (e.g. automating your monthly budget)  
3. Slow. Activities that feed your soul. The point is not to finish them, but to participate in them. (e.g. being with family; meditation or prayer; washing the dishes, if you're like me!)
