title: "Resources: Connecting with your inner child as therapy and practice"
---

A practice that I find helpful in both meditation and therapy is connecting with my inner child. Like any practice in meditation in therapy, I've developed my own approach to this based on an eclectic mix of sources. However, a friend recently asked me where they would start if they wanted to explore this idea themself.

1. "5 Queer Inner Child Practices", a blog article by Tiffany Landry, available [online](https://www.tiffany-landry.com/blog/5-queer-inner-child-practices)  
2. [Reconciliation: Healing the Inner Child](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9513034-reconciliation), a book by Thich Nhat Hanh (Buddhist perspective but Thay is well-known for his success in translating this message to secular and Christian perspectives too, as he writes for primarily American audiences)
3. [Introduction to Internal Family Systems](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43498454-introduction-to-internal-family-systems), a book by Dr Richard C. Schwartz (secular psychology perspective from the "internal family systems" model of therapy)
4. [Unlocking the Emotional Brain: Eliminating Symptoms at Their Roots Using Memory Reconsolidation](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17054323-unlocking-the-emotional-brain), a book by Bruce Ecker et al (secular psychology perspective from the "memory reconsolidation" model of therapy)
