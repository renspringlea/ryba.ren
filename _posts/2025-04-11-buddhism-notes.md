title: "Resources on Buddhism"
---

<p class="c10 c15"><span class="c0">As I mentioned, I think it  \ns important to keep in mind that meditation, spirituality etc are very individual, so what has helped me might not necessarily be what you need. That said, here are some resources I've found useful/enjoyable. Please take what resonates with you and ignore what does not. All areas of spirituality, personal development, etc have just a deluge of content, so sometimes I even find it helpful to focus on a single resource, or even a single paragraph or sentence that resonates with me at the time and go deep rather than wide, particularly when I'm feeling overwhelmed.</span></p><p class="c1 c15"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10 c15"><span class="c0">Guided meditations:</span></p><ul class="c17 lst-kix_rcpww8emsn5j-0 start"><li class="c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DjPpUNAFHgxM&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1743642739773687&amp;usg=AOvVaw2BcKNzYQSY-fRsBTw-jYcA">A guided meditation with a recording of Alan Watts that I used to listen to regularly</a></span></li><li class="c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.audiodharma.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1743642739773849&amp;usg=AOvVaw0h2y8c7BYBVE5UxWdf-MhR">Audio Dharma</a></span><span class="c0">, which has daily guided meditations. Gil Frondsal usually does the main talks, and each week (Mon - Fri) has a theme. Most days will have a 30-minute &quot;Guided Meditation&quot; and also a short dharma talk afterwards, which I would sometimes listen to. Also available as an app, on Spotify, etc.</span></li></ul><p class="c10 c15"><span class="c0">I am part of the Plum Village tradition, as founded by Thich Nhat Hanh - a strong focus on adapting the practice to the Western context, meeting people where they are, and engaged Buddhism / social justice:</span></p><ul class="c17 lst-kix_tog17f5dy9mo-0 start"><li class="c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.plumline.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1743642739774894&amp;usg=AOvVaw3gGtylJu_Xj5nNInsb_tSb">A list of online communities that meet regularly to practice together</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;- I've been to a couple of sessions of the Chrysanthemum Sangha, which has a queer focus and a dedicated safe space day each week for queer people, absolutely wonderful and welcoming to new people.

It made sense once I read Making Space (below). The Audio Dharma talks I found better to begin with, as they are more conversational.</span></li><li class="c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcv7KJIAsiddB2YRegvrF7g&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1743642739776539&amp;usg=AOvVaw22UvzQ3lijJPFp5RXcJq6X">Lots of talks available here</a></span></li><li class="c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCytzR1tkUYoF5DjGYiYkhGQ&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1743642739776761&amp;usg=AOvVaw0iHnxazeZDLlThUiYt_ttn">Some more talks here</a></span></li><li class="c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D4IkXnr3zlOw&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1743642739777019&amp;usg=AOvVaw2BgiuC-hd51mvSEzD22JEj">Recently enjoyed this talk, bit of a banger!!</a></span></li></ul><p class="c10 c15"><span class="c13">I haven't tried this myself, but another member of my local group says she enjoys </span><span class="c6"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://mindfulleader.org/meditate-together&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1743642739777436&amp;usg=AOvVaw0G18M-5-u5_mVeYvp_C1t-">Meditate Together</a></span><span class="c0">, which has online, group meditations every hour of the day.</span></p><p class="c1 c15"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10 c15"><span class="c0">Some books - notably Buddhism has a strong focus on experience rather than what people say or write, so there is an emphasis on putting the books down and not being so attached to them, but I do find them useful as I enjoy reading!

The theory suggests that there are 5 levels of development, and there are different mechanisms - generally involving productive struggle / internal conflict, hence 'positive distintegration' - to reach higher levels of development. This theory has been mostly studied in research on giftedness and gifted development, which is how I encountered it. This article, 'Lives of Positive Disintegration', talks about four exemplars of people who have reached the highest level of development, often under the worst conditions imaginable. I found the story of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etty_Hillesum">Etty Hillesum</a> from the Holocaust to be particularly profound, and I've read her diaries.</span></li></ul><p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p>
