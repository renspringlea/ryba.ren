## *Gatha* - Lianhua Kedu  
Get naked, and the ease you feel  
will know no end,  
As you manifest most gloriously  
your original true self.  
At daybreak, change the water  
and light the incense.  
It's all about the ordinary things  
of the everyday world.  

## *The Chrysanthemum* - Zhisheng (1635-1653)  
The hanging screen secretly exudes the fragrance  
Of a flower more exotic than any adorned beauty.  
It does not wilt along with the autumn grasses,  
But stands alone defying the heavy frost.  

## *A Leisurely Visit to an Ancient Temple* (excerpt) - Zukui Xuanfu  
The incense burner in the ancient temple  
has been left to grow cold.  
The fallen flowers and fragrant grasses  
keep chattering orioles company.
[...]  
The evening sun sets in the west,  
while the river flows east.  
Standing alone, I cannot hear  
a single human voice.  

## *My Aspirations* - Zukui Xuanfu  
The Way of the Buddhas and Patriarchs  
is both profound and subtle.  
It can be realized at all different levels,  
according to different people's needs.  
People of these later times are second-rate  
and do not understand what this means.  
Brandishing swords, they chase in pursuit  
of the transmission of the robes!  

## *The Second Month of Autumn: A Parting Poem* (excerpt) - Jizong Xingche (b. 1606)  
[...]  
It is not my lot in life to be a lofty recluse,  
At times found living in seclusion, and at times not.  
When one is mindless, one can settle down with tigers.  
Full of resolve, one can live among quails.  
[...]  

## *Presented to Layman Xu Jingke* (excerpt) - Jizong Xingche (b. 1606)  
When one knows ephemeral fame  
to be no more than an illusion,  
One may distance oneself from the world  
and build oneself a hermitage.  
In front of the courtyard, the slender bamboo  
allows the moon to hide;  
Below the eaves, the winding brook  
allows the fish to freely swim.  
[...]  
Do not allow the affairs of the world  
to uselessly drag you along.  
The Han pavilions and Qin palaces  
are now nothing but ruins.
