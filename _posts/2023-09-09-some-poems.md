1.\
scent of warm fur\
flash in the night\
Kingdom of God

2.\
a half-dozen knots\
in a tangled matrix of string\
grace

3.\
in dawnâ€™s single ray\
the divine spirit\
sitting on the fence

4.\
freckles\
paint my nails\
crocodile

5.\
the Naledi child,\
three hundred thousand years\
in a silent tomb.
