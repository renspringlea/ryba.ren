1.\
where's the moon?\
the temple bell sunk\
to the bottom of the sea\
(436)

2.\
ah spring, spring,\
great is spring,\
etcetera\
(33)

3.\
peacefully secluded here,\
I would love to pick fruit\
and the grains of grass\
(444)

4.\
that's something to see—\
chrysanthemums after\
autumn's storm\
(96)

5.\
wake up! wake up!\
let's be friends,\
sleeping butterfly\
(44)
