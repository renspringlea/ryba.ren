1. A few years ago, when I was first beginning to practice, I felt myself pulled in two directions: I wanted to devote all of my time to practice and enjoying peace and tranquility, but I also wanted to work hard to help those in need.
2. Transcenders often see the being-realm and deficiency-realm not as a dichotomy, but as two parts of a whole (Kaufman, Scott B 2020, *Transcending: The New Science of Self-Actualization*).
3. Larry Ward: "Living your life - *that's* what practicing means." (Ward, Larry 2016, *Unshakable Deliverance of the Mind*, [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JiXqUf3Vlg))
4. Thich Nhat Hanh: "My dear friend, if I do not plant this lettuce, I will not be able to write poetry." - Foreword to *Learning True Love: Practicing Buddhism in a Time of War* by Sister Chan Kong 1993 & 2007.
5. The reverse must also be true. If Thay did not write poetry, he would not have been able to plant lettuce.
