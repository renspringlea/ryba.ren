*In a [previous blog post]({% post_url 2024-08-23-porties %}), I provided some neat visuals of the suburb where I grew up over the past 100 years. In this blog post, I'm briefly looking at the data about population growth rates.*

I've noticed that the character of the suburbs where I grew up (Noarlunga, a group of suburbs of Adelaide in South Australia that are classified under the Onkaparinga local government area) have been changing in the past few years. It seems to me, subjectively, that the number of people is increasing. Spacious family homes are being knocked down and the land subdivided to build multiple townhouses on the same land. Cafés *seem* busier. My mother reports that it's harder to get a park at the local beach, where she has been swimming every summer for 30 years. My teammate, who lives nearby, reports that it's harder to turn onto the main road from their house!

For sure, I don't mean to criticise change *per se*! People need a place to live, and South Australia is a great place to live. I also have no complaints about Australia's highly politicised immigration policies—if anything, I think that Australia should be permitting more immigration, especially on humanitarian grounds. I'm just curious about whether these subjective impressions of population growth are actually correct or whether I'm [yelling at the proverbial cloud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJ-LivK4-78).

Here's some data [from the government](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/population/regional-population-age-and-sex/latest-release#data-downloads). (Nice to live in a country where there is reliably available and high-quality data about the country's society and economy.)

In the Onkaparinga local government area, in 2001 (when I was 5 years old, running around the streets and causing mischief until dark) there was an estimated 150,119 residents. In 2023, there was an estimated 180,865 residents. This equates to an increase, over that 22-year period, of ~20%. The growth rate is similar for nearby local government areas, such as Marion (25% increase) and Holdfast Bay (16% increase).

All else being equal, and speaking very roughly, that means that for every 10 beach users on a typical evening in 2001, there are about 12 today. For every 10 road users in 2001, there are about 12 today. For every 5 café customers in 2001, there are about 6 today.

Certainly, that is an increase, but it's not a massive increase. It's a smaller increase than I'd have estimated on the basis of my subjective impression.
