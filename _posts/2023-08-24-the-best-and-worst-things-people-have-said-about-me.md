* Best: "You are extremely talented and also a delight to work with, which is a rare combination."
* Worst: "This is clearly an attempt to continue promulgating pseudoscience in the literature by publishing it in meritorious scientific journals."
* Best: "Restores my faith in humanity."
* Worst: "Sam Bankman-Fried has nothing on you."
* So it's probably not worth placing too much faith into what people say about me!
