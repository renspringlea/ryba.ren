- Wear a face mask by default (reduce chance of getting sick -> fewer sick days)
- Set a reminder for an annual flu jab (same benefit as above)
- Set a reminder for a six-monthly blood test (same as above; plus you might randomly be deficient in things like Vitamin D that would be an easy fix and noticeably improve your wellbeing if addressed)
- Buy a "Better Bedder" (easier to change sheets -> change sheets more frequently -> better average sleep quality)
- Use comforters rather than blankets (they're just blankets you wash as a whole thing rather than taking the sheet off; same benefit as above)
- Buy the optimal pillow (latex!) and mattress (Koala mattress or similar)
- If you use a VPN, pay the extra money for a dedicated IP (less time and energy wasted on CAPTCHAs)
- [Batch emails](https://kennethfriedman.org/thoughts/2018/batch-gmail/) and Slack notifications, specifically to a period after your deep work period (can work undisturbed without your brain switching contexts)
- Buy an automated coffee maker (less time spent making coffee during focus time)
- Buy really nice open-air headphones (e.g. Shokz) plus a nice phone holder (e.g. Flip Belt) (more pleasant to exercise -> more frequent exercise -> better sleep, health and focus)
- Buy a [mechanical keyboard and trackball mouse](https://plaintext-productivity.net/4-05-hardware.html) (faster typing, fewer errors, and more pleasant to work -> less time wasted on fixing mistakes and more time spent focusing on work)
- Eat the same thing every day (less time thinking about your body and less energy spent having to think about what to eat -> can focus for longer and switch brain tasks less frequently, and also probably generally healthier if the thing you're eating is any good)
- Install light-blocking curtains (better sleep -> better focus; reduces suboptimal amounts of light and/or suboptimal temperature during the day -> easier to focus on work and to focus for longer)
- If you have an air conditioner, use it liberally (same benefits as above; possible negative effects in terms of carbon emissions, so it depends on where you live and where your energy is derived from - South Australia is like 60-75% renewables so the cost-benefit analysis works out more strongly in my case. not sure how this applies to people with "radiators" or "thermostats", never quite understood those things.)
- Join a casual sports team (basically locks you into a set anount of exercise and socialising each week -> improved mood/focus/health and less time spent thinking about whether/how to exercise/socialise on a day-to-day basis)
- Set a monthly or quarterly reminder to test your smoke alarm. If you have a gas stove, buy and install a carbon monoxide alarm and a gas leak alarm.
