I often get into (good-natured!) fights with my partner because horror movies frighten her but not me. I find economic policies and biosecurity disasters to be much more frightening.

Here are the death counts of a few horror movies and series, including animals, but not including historical deaths that are part of the backstory only:
- The Conjuring: 1 death
- The Conjuring 2: 0 deaths
- The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It: 3 deaths
- Paranormal Activity: 2 deaths
- The Haunting of Hill House (Mike Flanagan series): ~10 deaths (including the deaths from natural causes)

Compare this to:
- The mental and behavioural effects of the 2008 recession in Italy: 548 deaths ([source](https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/article-abstract/24/3/419/476146))
- The economic effects of COVID-19 in the United States: 35,700 - 144,483 deaths ([source](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2021.306490))
- Austerity policies in the UK after 2010: 190,000 deaths ([source](https://eprints.lse.ac.uk/123915/1/WP_139.pdf))
- The 2014-15 highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak in the United States: 50 million farmed chicken deaths ([source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956053X19302600))

It's like these ghosts and demons aren't even trying! Maybe demons and ghost training should involve a mandatory placement in a country's treasury or agriculture department.
