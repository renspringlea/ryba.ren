1. The wise wake up. They choose reason over custom. They fix their minds on the sublime and let their bodies change with the seasons. All phenomena are empty. They contain nothing worth desiring. […] Those who understand this detach themselves from all that exists and stop imagining or seeking anything. (5, *Outline of Practice*)
2. If you seek direct understanding, don’t hold onto any appearances whatsoever, and you’ll succeed. I have no other advice. The sutras say, ‘All appearances are illusions.’ They have no fixed existence, no constant form. They’re impermanent. Don’t cling to appearances, and you’ll be of one mind with the Buddha. (27, *Bloodstream Sermon*)
3. The buddha is your mind. Don’t misdirect your worship. (29, *Bloodstream Sermon*)
4. One mortals see their nature, all attachments end. Awareness isn’t hidden. But you can only find it right now. It’s only now. If you really want to find the Way, don’t hold onto anything. Once you put an end to karma and nurture your awareness, any attachments that remain will come to an end. Understanding comes naturally. You don’t have to make any effort. (35, *Bloodstream Sermon*)
5. A buddha is an idle person. He doesn’t run around after fortune and fame. What good are such things in the end? (35, *Bloodstream Sermon*)
