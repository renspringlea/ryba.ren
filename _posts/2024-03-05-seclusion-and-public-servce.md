From Bill Porter, *Road to Heaven: Encounters with Chinese Hermits*, chapter 3:

For some, following the Tao meant a life of seclusion. For others, it meant a life of public service. Regardless of the choice a given individual may have made, throughout Chinese history there was a never-ending dialectic between these two alternatives. In the Chutzu [a classic anthology attributed to Qu Yuan and also known as the *Chu Ci*], “The Fisherman” continues the dialogue:\
\
when Ch’u Yuan was banished\
he wandered along rivers\
he sang on their banks\
weak and forlorn\
till a fisherman asked\
aren’t you the Lord of the Gorges\
what fate has brought you to this\
and Ch’u Yuan answered\
the world is muddy\
I alone am clean\
everyone is drunk\
I alone am sober\
and so they sent me away\
and the fisherman said\
a sage isn’t bothered by others\
he can change with the times\
if the world is muddy\
splash in the mire\
if everyone is drunk\
drink up the dregs\
why get banished\
for deep thought and purpose\
and Ch’u Yuan said he had heard\
when you clean your hair\
you should dust off your hat\
when you take a bath\
you should shake out your robe\
why should I let something so pure\
be ruined and wronged by others\
I’d rather jump into the Hsiang\
and be buried in a fish’s gut\
than let something so white be stained by common dirt\
the fisherman smiled and rowed away singing\
when the Tsanglang is clear I wash my hat\
when the Tsanglang is muddy I wash my feet\
and once gone he was heard from no more

An interpretation of this story from the website of The Met Museum:\
"Dejected at his banishment from the capital, Qu complains to the fisherman of a world gone mad. The fisherman replies that Qu should take the world as it comes and adapt to changing circumstances."
