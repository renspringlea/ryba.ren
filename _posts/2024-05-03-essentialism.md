- "We live in a world where almost everything is worthless and a very few things are exceptionally valuable."
- "Essentialism is about pausing constantly to ask, 'Am I investing in the right activities?' [...] Before saying yes to anything, ask yourself, 'Will this activity or effort make the highest possible contribution towards my goal?' [...] If it isn’t a clear yes, then it’s a clear no."
- "Is this the most important thing I can be doing?"
- "When we have increased options and opportunities, which is actually code for demands upon our time and energies, it leads to diffused efforts. We get spread thinner and thinner."
- "You have to look at every opportunity and say 'Well, no.'"
- Being extremely selective - for any decision, think of the most important criterion, and rate each choice as a percent on that criterion. Anything below a 90 is automatically a 0. Don't get stuck with the 60s and 70s or even 80s!
- "The essentialist designs a routine that makes what you have identified as essential the default position. [...] enshrines what is essential, making execution almost effortless."
