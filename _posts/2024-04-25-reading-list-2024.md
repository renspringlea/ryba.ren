I've aimed for books that are truly excellent, or even great, with 8 books for each of my four favourite genres: classic literature, contemporary queer fiction, history/political history, and science. I've added 6 books for religion. Book #39 is a bonus, Murakami's newest novel being released in November. Audiobooks only. R denotes a re-read.

## Classics
Criteria: a proper classic, would be in contention for best-of-all-time
1. To Kill a Mockingbird (Harper Lee) (R)
2. The Picture of Dorian Gray (Oscar Wilde)
3. Fahrenheit 451 (Ray Bradbury)
4. Brave New World (Aldous Huxley)
5. The Last Man (Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley)
6. Hamlet (Shakespeare)
7. Anna Karenina (Leo Tolstoy)
8. Mrs Dalloway (Virginia Woolf)

## Queer fiction
Criteria: Goodreads > 4.2 & release date > 5 years ago
1. Those Who Wait (Haley Cass)

8. Felix Ever After (Kacen Callender)

## Politics and history
Criteria: from AskHistorians Master Book List or written by a proper professor-level historian
1. Tides of History podcast Season 4: Prehistory (Patrick Wyman) (not a book - sue me. included because it's genuinely extremely high-quality and Wyman has done a superb job of reviewing the most recent scientific literature from various disciplines relating to the stone age all around the world. in practice i'll only listen to the first 49 eps, which seems to focus more on the stone age - which i'm more interested in.)
2. Paul: A Very Short Introduction (EP Sanders)
3. Postwar: A history of Europe since 1945 (Tony Judt)
4. The Landscape of History (John Lewis Gaddis)
5. The Search for Modern China (Jonathan Spence) (R)
6. The Palestinian-Israeli Conflict: A Very Short Introduction (Martin Bunton)
7. Embracing Defeat (John Dower)
8. The Balkans (Mark Mazower)

## Science
Criteria: from AskScience book list, a recognised classic, or (Goodreads > 4.2 & written by a proper professor-level scientists)
1. Conscious: A Brief Guide to the Fundamental Mystery of the Mind (Annaka Harris)
2. The Character of Physical Law (Richard Feynman)
3. From Eternity to Here (Sean Carroll)
4. The Gene: An Intimate History (Siddhartha Mukherjee)
5. Cosmos (Carl Sagan)
6. Chaos: Making a New Science (James Gleick)
7. Alien Earths: The New Science of Planet Hunting in the Cosmos (Lisa Kaltenegger)
8. The Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory (David Chalmers) (maybe R, might be wrong)

## Religion
I've aimed for a mix of religions and for books written by top-notch academics/theologians or masterful practitioners. These can be physical books, since the trilogy is certainly a great work in its own right but doesn't exist in audiobook - and I already have physical copies of the first three anyway.
1. An Anthology of Poetry by Buddhist Nuns of Late Imperial China (Beata Grant)
2. The Meaning of Jesus: Two Visions (Wright and Borg)
3. The Novice (Thich Nhat Hanh)
4. Judaism: Between Yesterday and Tomorrow (Hans Kueng)
5. Christianity: Its Essence and History (Hans Kueng)
6. Islam: Past, Present and Future (Hans Kueng)

## Pending release
1. The City and Its Uncertain Walls (Haruki Murakami) - release November
