Remember: Sturgeon's law was published in 1957â€”think of how much cheaper it has become to produce information since then!  

Protecting one's own attention (regulating the information that comes in)  
- Physical space. Clearing the clutter on one's desk. Putting away food containers with writing on them.  
- Digital space. Hardcore ad blockers! Email filters. Not using email or social media. Keeping the functionality of every tool to an absolute minimum. Checking communication tools once a day. Make it really easy to do the essential tasks and really awful to do other stuff.  
- Sound. White noise, ambient music.  
- Mental environment. Mindfulness and CBT superpowers. Avoiding binge browsing. Sleep. Exercise.  
- Social environment.  

Protecting others' attention (regulating the information that goes out)  
- High-quality communication: detailed when it needs to be (overcommunication is good communication!) but avoiding unnecessary details or topics.  
- Involving the essential people only.  
- Sending messages to a given recipient in bulk as much as possible (it's easier to read one message on five topics than five messages at different times on different topics).  
- Ideally, placing a delay between the impulse of needing to communicate with someone and actually sending the message.
