title: "In-and-out searches vs exhaustive searches"
---
When searching for information, there are two different approaches.

The first is the in-and-out search. e.g. I absolutely need to know which team won the WNBA championship in 2022, but nothing more. This is more appropriate when I'm curious about a particular tidbit of information and either the stakes are low or the information is simple.

The second is the exhaustive search. e.g. I need to know everything there is to know about the economics of salmon production in Norway. This takes much, much longer. It's called "exhaustive" for a reasonâ€”it takes lots of work! This is more appropriate when the stakes are high and the information is closely related to my theory of change.

I've found it useful to keep in mind which approach is necessary. This way, in the former case, I don't get stuck searching for unnecessary details simply because my brain wants to know more. In the latter case, I can mentally prepare and make sure I set aside the appropriate amount of time (usually days, weeks, or months).
