* • Ren Ryba (they/them)
* • I live and work on the unceded land of the Kaurna people
* • "Ryba" means "fish" in Slovak, and it rhymes with "sneezer"
* • I like [books](books.html), [tattoos](tattoos.html), and [soccer](soccer.html)

## My work
* • [My animal advocacy research (Animal Ask website)](https://www.animalask.org/research)
* • [My academic publications (Google Scholar)](https://www.scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=hCCZcZYAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate)
* • [Additional research and hot takes (Effective Altruism Forum)](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/ren-ryba)

## Blog
*RSS feed [here](feed.xml)*  
(This is a place where I share hot takes and tidbits. I'm making no attempt to be rigorous—these are much closer to journal entries than academic publications. Every topic I mention has been explored—and critiqued!—with much more rigour elsewhere.)
