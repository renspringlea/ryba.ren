*she/her \| Kaurna land (South Australia)*  

*Proudly transgender 🏳️‍⚧️ and autistic ♾️*  

I advocate for animal rights and welfare. I have been involved in working to improve laws for the billions of chickens, fish, pigs, and other animals commodified by economic systems and tortured by routine industrial practices.

I am a researcher and an analyst, and I enjoy helping projects run smoothly through operations, administration, and automation. I'm currently a grant evaluator at the [EA Funds Animal Welfare Fund](https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/funds/animal-welfare) and an independent contractor on several animal welfare campaigns.

From 2021 to 2025, I worked at Animal Ask where I helped to maximize the impact of animal advocacy campaigns on every continent except Antarctica. I have run for parliament with the Animal Justice Party, and I have worked in the fisheries department of state government.  

I am the proud parent of two special needs rescue dogs, Max and Shiloh 🐶🐶. Outside of work, I enjoy playing soccer, getting tattoos, and reading about history and space exploration.

"Ryba" is pronounced "REE-ber" and it means "fish" in Slovak. I use my middle name Grace in my everyday life, but I use my first name Ren professionally. Feel free to use either.
