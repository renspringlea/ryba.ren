My work focuses on animal advocacy. I have been deeply involved in numerous fish welfare projects in particular. I worked at Animal Ask from 2021 to 2025, and I'm now an independent contractor. I like researching things, planning things, and organising things. I'm the proud parent of two special-needs rescue dogs.  

I have experience in ecology, fisheries science, and statistics from my time in academia and government. I enjoy thinking about politics and social justice. I like soccer!  

* Proudly transgender and neurodivergent
